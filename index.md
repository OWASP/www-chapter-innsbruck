## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Innsbruck Chapter, your regional chapter in Tyrol, Austria.

Whether you are a developer, a cybersecurity professional or someone who is simply interested in software and application security, OWASP Innsbruck provides a platform for learning, knowledge sharing and networking. Through a variety of events and initiatives, we strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute, learn and grow.

## First Meeting

Our first event is scheduled and it will happen on 30th October 2025!

We would like to sincerely thank the Wirtschaftskammer (WKO) Tyrol for kindly providing their facilities and support, as well as Peter Stelzhammer, speaker of the IT Security Experts Group Tyrol of the WKO, for his effort to make this happen.
