## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Innsbruck Chapter, your regional chapter in Tyrol, Austria.

Whether you are a developer, a cybersecurity professional or someone who is simply interested in software and application security, OWASP Innsbruck provides a platform for learning, knowledge sharing and networking. Through a variety of events and initiatives, we strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute, learn and grow.

## Innsbruck Chapter

OWASP Innsbruck was formed in 2025 by Bettina and Sven Schleier.
