### 2nd OWASP Chapter Innsbruck meeting - 2nd December 2025

Talk (will be in German): How To Breach: From Unconventional Initial Access Vectors To Modern Lateral Movement - by Benjamin Floriani - [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VC3xqvsbw4ik1Gc9bbzju6tSmpbTYcIy/view?usp=sharing)

Abstract: The perpetual cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders has pushed offensive security operators to innovate. While enterprise security teams have become adept at identifying and blocking malicious Office documents, suspicious executables, and known phishing URLs, a significant blind spot often remains: the gray area of "benign" file formats that are implicitly trusted by both users and security tools. This talk will arm attendees with the knowledge to identify and leverage these blind spots in red team engagements.

**About Benjamin Floriani**:

My fascination about complex systems began early on - with hacking computer games. While studying computer science at the University of Innsbruck, I discovered the Austrian Cyber Security Challenge, a capture-the-flag competition that promotes IT security talents in Austria.

My successful participation in this competition opened my way into professional IT security at the end of 2017. Since then, I have been pursuing my passion as a penetration tester. I have specialized in the field of red teaming and attack simulations through numerous further education and training courses - a field that continues to fascinate me.

I am currently deepening my knowledge in the areas of internal infrastructures and malware development. This enables me not only to increase the precision of our penetration tests, but also to implement techniques such as lateral movement, local privilege escalation and full domain compromise in red team engagements even more effectively.
